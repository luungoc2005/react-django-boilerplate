This is a boilerplate for a project I'm working on
Includes
- Backend Django + SQLite
- Frontend React + Material UI + Toast (for responsive pages) + Normalizr (bits of HTML5 boilerplate) + Webpack

### Installation
Run `npm install` to install npm dependencies

### Using this project
Migrations
You probably should setup a new database yourself and setup like any other Django projects with `python manage.py sqlmigrate` and all

To try out the site

Or run
`npm run webpack` or `npm run webpack-watch` to compile modules
